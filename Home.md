# Introduction #

Sauron is a Virtual Tour framework for web designers, that allows to embed
3D views of a location to a website in a CPU-friendly way.
It's primary (intended) application is to enable users to enter buildings
online (using nothing else but their web browsers).

Since it is based entirely on HTML and Javascript,
it works without the need for further software installations,
in particular without Java and Flash.

# Features #
Major features of Sauron are, that you may attach
  * meta information
  * URLs (links)
  * pictures and
  * videos
to objects in 3D space.
This way the user shall be given a realistic impression of a
location he may never have visited in reality.
